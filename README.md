### About

SwedevCo is a website dedicated to all employers, companies, even private people who want to post or looking for a job in the tech sector on the site. The website allows users to create an account and be able to post, edit and delete posts according to (Create,Read, Update, Delete). The website is created in a responsive design that is very handy to search or post a job from mobile devices to tablets or larger screens.
This website is made to prepare my Milestone Data-centric project with Code Institute.
This web application was made by Flask and MongoDB, the frontend was designed using materialize.
